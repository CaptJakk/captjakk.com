title: Hello, World!

Because what the hell else was my first post going to be? Hi. My name is Keagan, or possibly more
recognizably "CaptJakk" online. I have been wanting to spin up a blog for some time, and never made
the time for it. So, finally, here it is. The reason I finally got around to doing this is I have
my second [LC](https://lambdaconf.zohobackstage.com/LambdaConf2019?lang=en#/agenda?day=3&lang=en&sessionId=6967000000359734)
talk coming up, and wanted to get a draft of that talk down on paper in an essay
like format first. I also wanted the essay version to be posted here.

In the future you can expect a few different categories of posts and I'll try to find some way to
partition them as such:

* Philosophy: musings about how I choose to operate in my day to day life and how I make large 
decisions. This is probably more for me than any of you, but perhaps others could benefit.
* Economics/Game Theory: much of this will be related to cryptocurrencies and the economic theory
that goes into designing them, but also occasionally stuff related to financial markets.
* Functional Programming: This is likely to be the main focus of what I talk about here.

Now that I have this intro out of the way, it's time to start the first draft of my talk.

Until next time.

Peace.
