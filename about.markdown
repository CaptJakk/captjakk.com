My name is Keagan McClelland. On the internet I go by various incarnations of CaptJakk, hence the
name of this blog. I am a software engineer by trade and like to work on projects related to 
finance and cryptocurrency. I am also a huge Haskell/FP nerd and will never pass up a chance to
evangilize it.
